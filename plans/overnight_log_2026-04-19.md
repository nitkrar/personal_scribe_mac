# Overnight autonomous execution log — 2026-04-19

User went offline. Autonomous Claude continues Phase 3 execution under these rules (per user direction):

- Max 4 concurrent codex agents at a time.
- If Santa blocks build/test for any codex agent → instruct agent to skip all `swift build` / `swift test` and keep producing commits; user will run tests manually in the morning.
- If an agent appears stuck (>2× median completion time) → `SendMessage` to probe what's blocking; apply Santa mitigation if that's the cause; else council-review.
- **Council review** for any conflict or would-have-asked moment: (a) codex independent analysis, (b) Claude independent analysis, (c) my own synthesis, (d) decide based on 2-of-3 consensus, leaning conservative if split, (e) log the reasoning.
- No design-inflection decisions made unilaterally — park and surface in morning with analysis.
